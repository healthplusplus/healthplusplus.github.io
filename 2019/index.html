    <h1>Nick Haber, PhD</h1>
    <h5>Co-founder of the Autism Glass Project</h5>
    <p>
       Nick Haber is a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford who specializes in artificial intelligence, cognitive modeling, and technological applications of these to medical devices. He is the co-founder of the Autism Glass Project (autismglass.stanford.edu), an initiative
 to make and test a prototype that uses Google Glass and computer vision as a learning tool for children with autism. His artificial intelligence work focuses on creating artificial systems that can explore their surroundings as children do: playfully and socially.
 Put another way, he seeks to make robots that gather their own training data. With this, he aims to make more flexible and adaptive robotics and AI-powered devices, as well as to better understand how we learn as children.
