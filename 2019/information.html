    <h1>Ami Bhatt, MD</h1>
    <h5>Assistant Prof of Medicine and Genetics</h5>
    <p>
        Dr. Bhatt is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Genetics at Stanford University. A 2014 ASH Scholar and 2016 Damon Runyon Clinical Investigator Award Winner, she currently leads a translational laboratory group (bhattlab.com) in the Departments of Medicine and Genetics at Stanford University. The goal of the Bhatt lab is to understand the interplay between the microbial environment in patients with noncommunicable diseases, especially those with hematological malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma). The laboratory focuses on (1) the use of next generation sequencing to define the microbiome and host immunologic features in patients with hematological diseases and (2) developing custom computational tools for the identification of novel human commensals and pathogens in these immunosuppressed patient populations, and (3) using statistical and functional biological methods to understand the interplay between the human microbiome and the development of immunological diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to her academic efforts, Ami is committed to improving cancer care, education and research in resource-limited settings. She is the Director of Global Oncology for the Center for Innovation in Global Health at Stanford University and is this yearâ€™s Rosenkranz Prize winner (for her Global Health research work). She, along with Franklin Huang, is a co-founder and co-president of the non-profit organization Global Oncology (http://globalonc.org). GO spearheads creative, multi-disciplinary projects focused on improving cancer outcomes in impoverished settings. Outside of her day job, she enjoyed the outdoors and mentoring passionate students and trainees. She is incredibly proud of two of her mentees (Jason Wang and Shivaal Roy), who along with a very talented group of undergraduates are making Stanford history today with its first ever Health Hackathon!
