                        <div class="answer">Think of a hackathon as a pop-up incubator, designed to help you kickstart your ideas into concrete projects and prototypes. Over the course of one intense weekend weekend, you'll come together with an amazing group of people to learn, ideate, and make.</div>

                        <div class="question">Who can attend?</div>
                        <div class="answer">We’re opening the door to engineers, designers, business experts, and healthcare professionals - students and faculty - passionate about healthcare innovation. Any undergraduate, graduate student, or working professional is invited to apply! </div>

                        <div class="question">What if I don't know how to code?</div>
                        <div class="answer">Fret not! <span class="highlight">health++</span> is a perfect place to start! We're working to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical in healthcare—so we welcome individuals of all skillsets. Our workshops and mentors will address any questions you might have. Whatever your interest or specialty, we’d love to see what you can create!</div>

                        <div class="question">Why <span class="highlight">health++</span>?</div>
                        <div class="answer"><span class="highlight">health++</span> is a student run event spearheading a larger movement to increase inter-departmental collaboration in the realm of healthcare. In drawing from the hackathon concept being successfully developed around the world, we hope to create a long-lasting community of hackers and innovators!</div>

                        <div class="question">What makes an ideal team?</div>
                        <div class="answer">You're welcome to bring friends, but a big part of <span class="highlight">health++</span> is forming cross-disciplinary teams - engineers, designers, business experts, and clinicians - and that means meeting new people! Each group brings a unique skillset critical to creating meaningful solutions. From our experience, multilateral teams like these have seen the greatest success.</div>

                        <div class="answer">On the morning of the first day, we’ll be opening the event with a keynote, panel, and then a live problem pitching session. Team formation will be taking place directly afterwards.</div>

                        <div class="question">Will travel funds be available?</div>
                        <div class="answer">This year, we are tentatively considering some form of travel support—either through limited reimbursements or bussing from nearby schools. If you are unsure of whether or not you will be able to attend without travel support, go ahead and apply now! We'll send out updates about travel as we get them.</div>

                        <div class="question">What makes a health hackathon unique?</div>
                        <div class="answer">There is a large disconnect between engineering students who want to code solutions to meaningful problems and healthcare professionals who understand how technology can be effectively applied to an unmet need. A health hackathon bridges this gap. The environment of a hackathon empowers students and faculty in healthcare with the technical resources and engineering talent needed to push their ideas through the prototyping process.</div>

                        <div class="question">At the end of the weekend, what should a finished project look like?</div>
                        <div class="answer">We’re looking for a prototype, business model, or ideally, a combination of the two! We love technical hacks, but we also want to emphasize the importance of delivery and cost. How will your project get into the hands of patients? How can you impact mental health, global health, or chronic disease in an affordable way? We want to see ideas and prototypes that have the potential to become reality.</div>

                        <div class="answer">The problem pitching session will take place on Saturday morning, the first day of the event. A form to submit pitches will be released closer to the event! Note that only participants and mentors will be eligible to pitch.</div>

                        <div class="answer">Bring your laptop and any accessories (charger, surge protector, personal hardware) that you might need. Our friends at MLH will be providing hardware to work with, and we'll have supplies for ideation on hand as well (lots and lots of post-its, markers, etc). Also, food will be provided!</div>

                        <div class="answer">Nothing, nada, zero, zilch. We'll provide meals, WIFI, workspace, swag, and a place to sleep over the weekend! </div>

                        <div class="question">Does <span class="highlight">health++</span> have a Code of Conduct?</div>
